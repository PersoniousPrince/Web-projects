# Web-projects

This repository is solely for just storing old projects I did a very, very, very long time ago. If it is public, feel free to look at the couple websites I cared to put in here when I was just learning HTML, CSS, and a sprinkle of JS. ðŸ™‚

- Most likely put in as compressed zip folders for a compact repository.
